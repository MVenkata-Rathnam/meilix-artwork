meilix-artwork comprises the sources for the two plymouth bootscreen theme packages for Meilix.

The naming follows the convention on debian family distributions see xubuntu-artwork etc.

We plan use Travis for debuilding the two debian packages, one for logo, one for text based startup screen.

These packages should be installable/testable on any Debian or Ubuntu derivate system and could be configured as the default boot screen.

See https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Plymouth/ for details.

The goal is to move the plymouth theme package debuilding from the meilix repository to this one.
