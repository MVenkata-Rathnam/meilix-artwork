meilix-artwork comprises the plymouth bootscreen theme packages for Meilix.

We use Travis for debuilding the two debian packages, one for logo, one for text based startup screen.

These packages should be installable/testable on any Debian or Ubuntu derivate system and could be configured as the default boot screen.

See https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Plymouth/ for details.

The goal is to move the plymouth theme package debuilding from the meilix repository to this one.
